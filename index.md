# Joshua Moore's First CS193 Homework

My Favorite Things About CS193 (As Of Now)

-The instructors seem genuinely really nice, laidback, and funny, which are the kind of people I tend to like, not only as instructors, but as people in general.

-The class has air conditioning. (Yes, I DO think having cool air is worth praising. I have math lectures three times a week.)

-The class as a whole manages to seem useful for my coding ability while still being a really chill (pun completely intended) class to attend. It is a nice change of pace compared to some of my other, slightly more tense, classes, and I really appreciate it for that.
